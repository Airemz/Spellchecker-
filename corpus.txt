ARREST WARRANT IF YOU CATCH THE CROOK BEFORE YOU HAVE A VALID WARRANT OR IF
YOUR TIME RUNS OUT YOU LOSE THE GAME INCLUDES A QUICK REFERENCE CARD ON EACH

INTERFACE THAT ANY MAC USER WILL LOVE YOU USE THE KEYBOARD ONLY TO ENTER YOUR
NAME AT THE START MOST ALL COUNTRIES IN EUROPE ARE DEPICTED BY GREAT
BLACK AND WHITE DRAWINGS SPECIFICALLY CREATED FOR THE MAC AS AN ADDED BONUS
SOME GRAPHICS DISPLAY IN COLOR ON THE MAC THE GAME ALSO OFFERS GOOD SOUND
EFFECTS AND ANIMATION SEQUENCES IN VARIOUS PLACES

WHERE IN EUROPE WORKS BEST WITH MORE THAN ONE PLAYER SINGLE PLAYER GAMES

PLACES DONT EVEN EXIST UNTIL YOU FIND THEM ON A MAP THE DOCUMENTATION INCLUDES
A RAND MCNALLY ATLAS OF EUROPE WHICH YOULL NEED ALONG WITH ANY OTHER GOOD
ATLASES OF EUROPE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO HELP YOU GET STARTED THERES ALSO AN
EXCELLENT MANUAL DESCRIBING GAMEPLAY AND OPERATIONAL DETAILS

THIS VERSION OF THE PROGRAM REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE KILOBYTES OF RAM AND RUNS ON THE
MAC FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE MAC PLUS MAC AND MAC I WAS UNABLE TO TEST COMPATIBILITY WITH
 THE OTHER TWO MACS BUT IT SHOULD WORK FINE WITH THESE
MACHINES AS WELL THE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE KILOBYTE MACS REQUIRE TWO FLOPPY DRIVES OR A HARD DISK THE
PROGRAM USES KEY DISK PROTECTION

WHERE IN EUROPE IS CARMEN SANDIEGO IS AN INTERESTING EDUCATIONAL AND
ALL AROUND FUN GAME THAT LOOKS AND PLAYS GREAT IT SHOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT
